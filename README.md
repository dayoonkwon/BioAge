# BioAge

This package measures biological aging using data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The package uses
published biomarker algorithms to calculate three biological aging
measures: Klemera-Doubal Method (KDM) biological age, phenotypic age,
and homeostatic dysregulation.

## Installation (via devtools):

You can install the released version of BioAge from
(<https://github.com/dayoonkwon/BioAge>) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dayoonkwon/BioAge")
```

## Example

This serves as an example of training biologial aging measures using the
NHANES 3 (1991) and NHANES 4 (1999 - 2018) dataset. It also provides
documentation for fit parameters contained in the BioAge package. The
cleaned NHANES dataset is loaded as the dataset `NHANES3` and `NHANES4`.
The original KDM bioage and phenoage values are saved as `kdm0` and
`phenoage0` as part of NHANES dataset.

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(BioAge) #topic of vignette
```

## Step 1: train in NHANES 3 and project in NHANES 4

I train in the NHANES 3 and project biological aging measures into the
NHANES 4 by using the `hd_nhanes`, `kdm_nhanes`, and `phenoage_nhanes`
function of the BioAge package.

``` r
#particular biomarkers
biomarkers = c("albumin","alp","lymph","mcv","lncreat","lncrp","hba1c","wbc","rdw")

#projecting HD using NHANES (seperate training for gender)
hd = hd_nhanes(biomarkers)

#projecting KDM bioage using NHANES (seperate training for gender)
kdm = kdm_nhanes(biomarkers)

#projecting phenoage uinsg NHANES
phenoage = phenoage_nhanes(biomarkers)
```

## Step 2: compare NHANES 4 to the original KDM bioage and phenoage

The projected data and estimated model above are saved as part of the
list structure. These can be drawn by typing `data` and `fit`,
respectively.

``` r
#pull the full dataset
data = merge(hd$data, kdm$data) %>% merge(., phenoage$data)
```

### Figure1: Chronological age vs biological aging measures

``` r
#select biological age variables
agevar = c("kdm0","phenoage0","kdm","phenoage","hd","hd_log")

#prepare labels
label = c("KDM\nBiological Age",
          "Levine\nPhenotypic Age",
          "Modified-KDM\nBiological Age",
          "Modified-Levine\nPhenotypic Age",
          "Mahalanobis\nDistance",
          "Log\nMahalanobis\nDistance")

#plot age vs bioage
plot_ba(data, agevar, label)
```

### Figure2: Corplot for biological aging measures

``` r
#select biological age advancement (BAA) variables
agevar = c("kdm_advance0","phenoage_advance0","kdm_advance","phenoage_advance","hd","hd_log")

#prepare lables
#values should be formatted for displaying along diagonal of the plot
#names should be used to match variables and order is preserved
label = c(
  "kdm_advance0"="KDM\nBiological\nAge",
  "phenoage_advance0"="Levine\nPhenotypic\nAge",
  "kdm_advance"="Modified\nKDM\nBiological\nAge",
  "phenoage_advance"="Modified\nLevine\nPhenotypic\nAge",
  "hd" = "Mahalanobis\nDistance",
  "hd_log" = "Log\nMahalanobis\nDistance")

#use variable name to define the axis type ("int" or "float")
axis_type = c(
  "kdm_advance0"="float",
  "phenoage_advance0"="float",
  "kdm_advance"="float",
  "phenoage_advance"="flot",
  "hd"="flot",
  "hd_log"="float")

#plot BAA corplot
plot_baa(data,agevar,label,axis_type)
```
