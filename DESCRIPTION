Author: Dayoon Kwon, Daniel Belsky
Maintainer: Dayoon Kwon <dayoonk@ucla.edu>
Description: This package measures biological aging using data from the
    National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The package
    uses published biomarker algorithms to calculate three biological
    aging measures: Klemera-Doubal Method biological age, phenotypic age,
    and homeostatic dysregulation.
